\section{Dataset}
Besides a less amount of fintech-specific journals, we assume that if a journal produces many fintech articles, most of the research in the journal could have highly relation to the fintech field even if the research themselves don't contain any fintech keyword in their main topics.
To have the most articles from the least amount of journals, we decided to use the Web of Science[-citation-] search engine and database to find out the journals that produced the most fintech articles.



Reference papers were collected by the WOS search engine with rules listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Topic: "\textbf{Fintech}" or "\textbf{Financial technology}" or "\textbf{digital finance}" or "\textbf{electronic banking}" or "\textbf{cryptocurrency}" or "\textbf{Blockchain}"
    \item publication years: 2003-2023
    \item Document Types: \textbf{Article} or \textbf{Proceeding Paper} or \textbf{Review Article}
    \item Languages: English
\end{itemize}

We got 66,974 results on 23rd July 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection and exported them to EndNote.
The \verb|Find Full Text| feature in EndNote is used to look for the full text of reference papers by their Accession numbers including Digital Object Identifier (DOI), WOS ID and PubMed ID.
This feature enables us to automatically batch-download loads of reference papers as PDF files if the journal is available in Open Access resources.
