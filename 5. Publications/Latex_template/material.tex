\section{Dataset}
The fintech domain presents itself as a multifaceted and interdisciplinary matter.
It intertwines principles from finance, technology, economics, computer science, data analytics, law, and consumer behaviour, among others.
Such convergence of knowledge domains makes it a compelling and complex area for interdisciplinary exploration and research but also makes it difficult to collect fintech articles from specific journals.
Hence, we decided to use the Web of Science[-citation-] search engine and database as our source of data.

Reference papers were collected by the WOS search engine with rules listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Topic: "\textbf{Fintech}" or "\textbf{Financial technology}" or "\textbf{digital finance}" or "\textbf{electronic banking}" or "\textbf{cryptocurrency}" or "\textbf{Blockchain}"
    \item publication years: 2003-2023
    \item Document Types: \textbf{Article} or \textbf{Proceeding Paper} or \textbf{Review Article}
    \item Languages: English
\end{itemize}

We got 66,974 results on 23rd July 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection and exported them to EndNote.
The \verb|Find Full Text| feature in EndNote is used to look for the full text of reference papers by their Accession numbers including Digital Object Identifier (DOI), WOS ID and PubMed ID.
This feature enables us to automatically batch-download loads of reference papers as PDF files if the journal is available in Open Access resources.
